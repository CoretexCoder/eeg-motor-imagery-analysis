# EEG Motor Movement Analysis

This repository contains an independent EEG analysis project developed to gain
hands-on experience with EEG preprocessing, spectral analysis, and
visualization using Python and MNE.

---

## Dataset

The analysis uses open-access EEG motor movement data from PhysioNet:

- EEG Motor Movement/Imagery Dataset (EEGMMIDB)  
  https://physionet.org/content/eegmmidb/1.0.0/

Raw EEG files are not included in this repository due to data-sharing
considerations.

## Project Overview

The project demonstrates a complete EEG analysis workflow, including:

- Loading raw EEG data (EDF format)
- Band-pass filtering (1–40 Hz)
- Power spectral density (PSD) estimation
- Extraction of mu (8–13 Hz) and beta (13–30 Hz) band power
- Topographical visualization of EEG power
